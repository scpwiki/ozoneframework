Ozone Framework for Wikijump is a modified version of the OZONE Framework for Wikidot, itself a modified version of the
OZONE Web Application Framework, created originally by Michal Frackowiak.

The current version of Ozone Framework is hosted at https://github.com/scpwiki/ozoneframework.
The original OZONE Framework has been hosted at http://ozoneframework.sourceforge.net

Efforts are being made to deprecate the Ozone dependency in Wikijump, but until it is removed from Wikijump's composer
file, please consider it integral to functionality.
